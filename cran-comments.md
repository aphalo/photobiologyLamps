Checks on Winbuilder and RHub trigger a spurious Note about URLs.

_In brief:_ the URLs flagegd under "Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:" are valid and functioning.

_In detail:_ 1) URL (https://www.sylvania.com/) is being redirected to a specific page within the same domain. 2) DOI URLs in an HTML vignette as well as some other URLs that open in a browser without problem either intermitently time out or report key or signature errors from libcurl. It seems to me preferable to retain the links as they are as they are valid and needed as references to sources.

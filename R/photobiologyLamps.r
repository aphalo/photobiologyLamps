#' @details
#' This pakage contains emission spectra for different types of lamps other than
#' LEDs. Measured with an assortment of different instruments over more than 20
#' years in our lab or by collaborators. Some of the lamp types are no longer in 
#' production but the data are relevant for the interpretation of old scientific 
#' publications. Data for lamps emitting in the UV and VIS regions of the 
#' spectrum are represented in these data sets.

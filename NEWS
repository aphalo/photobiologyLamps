photobiologyLamps 0.1.11
========================

All data is now in source.spct objects, except for a data.table with the temperature response data set.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.10
========================

Added functions D2_spectrum() and FEL_spectrum(). These functions use constants from high precision fits to known calibration lamps.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.9
=======================

Fixed bug introduced introduced yesterday in 0.1.8. calc_lamp_output was not doing the rescaling correctly and moved most of the code to calc_source_output() in package photobiology.
calc_lamp_output() now just calls calc_source_output() and its use is deprecated.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.8
=======================

Substantial changes to calc_lamp_output to simplify use and to correclty handle NAs and cases when extrapolation is involved.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.7
=======================

Changes to adjust code to changes in package photobiology version 0.2.16

photobiologyLamps 0.1.6
=======================

Added three spectra from UV lamps measured in the range 240 nm to 800 nm, with a Macam scanning
spectroradiometer with double monochromator. Data not as good as from the Bentham instrument
but measured over a wider range of wavelengths.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.5
=======================

Corrected wrong units in Betham data. It was in mW m-2 nm-1, while documentation 
indicated that it was in W m-2 nm-1. Data has been now rescaled. 

photobiologyLamps 0.1.4
=======================

Added data for Q-Panel UVB-313 lamp emission at different temperatures.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.3
=======================

Added function calc_lamp_output.
Wrote new vignette dataPlots with plots for all lamp data in the package.


photobiologyLamps 0.1.2
=======================

Merged some edits, and fixed some documentation bugs.

photobiologyLamps 0.1.1
=======================

Added data measured with a Bentham spectroradiometer.


photobiologyLamps 0.1.0
=======================

First version containing data measured with a LI-COR LI-1800 spectroradiometer.
